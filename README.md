Chess Engine that will always play worst move.

## Features

## Limitations

### No AI-based decision making: The application does not employ any advanced chess algorithms or AI techniques to improve its moves. It deliberately selects the worst possible moves, which can be predictable.
### Lack of multiplayer support: The application currently only supports single-player mode. You play against the application as the opposing player.
### No time control: The application does not provide any time control options. Players can take as much time as they need to make their moves.
### No game save or resume feature: The application does not offer a game save or resume functionality. Once the browser window is closed, the game progress is lost.

## The Dumbo-Chess is a fun and challenging chess experience that intentionally makes the worst possible moves. It provides a unique twist to the game, allowing players to test their skills against an opponent that consistently plays suboptimal moves. Enjoy the game and have fun!
